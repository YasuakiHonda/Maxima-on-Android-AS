INTRODUCTION
------------

The figures in this directory will be used in the Maxima manual.
Each figure should be in two versions, PDF and PNG. The PDF version
will be used in the PDF version of the manual, and the PNG version
will be used in the HTML version.

CREATING FIGURES FOR THE MAXIMA MANUAL
--------------------------------------

If the figures are the result of a plot2d or plot3d command, the two
versions needed can be created adding the options pdf_file and
png_file to the plotting command. For example, the two commands needed
for a figure named "plot24" might be:

  plot2d (sin(x), [x, -5, 5], [pdf_file, "plot24.pdf"]);
  plot2d (sin(x), [x, -5, 5], [png_file, "plot24.png"]);

ADDING FIGURES TO THE MANUAL
----------------------------

Once the files plot24.pdf and plot24.png have been placed in the
doc/info/figures directory, they are added in a section of the manual
using the figure macro:
  @figure{plot24}

Notice that no file-name extension or directory should be given. That
macro should add the figure correctly in any section and in any of the
translations of the manual.

ADDING THE FIGURE TO THE LIST OF FILES TO BE DISTRIBUTED
--------------------------------------------------------

Every time you add a new figure, do not forget to modify the
doc/info/Makefile.am file, adding the name of the two files (PDF and
PNG) to the lists "figurefiles" and "pdffigures". In the example
above,
  figures/plot24.png
should be added to figurefiles and
  figures/plot24.pdf
to pdffigures.

MACROS THAT HELP CREATING FIGURE FILES IN THE NEEDED FORMATS
------------------------------------------------------------

../docdraw.mac contains macros that create a figure in both formats
needed for building the documentation:

docdraw("test",gr2d(explicit(sin(x),x,1,10)));
docdraw2d("test",explicit(sin(x),x,1,10));
docdraw3d("test",explicit(sin(x)*cos(y),x,1,10,y,1,10));


INTRODUCTION
------------

The figures in this directory will be used in the Maxima manual.
Each figure should be in two versions, PDF and GIF. The PDF version
will be used in the PDF version of the manual, and the GIF version
will be used in the HTML version.

CREATING FIGURES FOR THE MAXIMA MANUAL
--------------------------------------

The figures can be obtained from the Postcript files created by the
Maxima plotting drivers. For example, figures plotting2.pdf and
plotting2.gif where obtained from the file plotting2.ps created with
the following Maxima commands:

  set_plot_option([gnuplot_ps_term_command,
     "set size 1.3, 1.3; set term postscript eps color solid lw 2.5 30"])$

  plot2d (sin(x), [x, -5, 5], [psfile,"plotting2.ps"])$

The size scaling of 1.3 was used to obtain a figure with a reasonable
size in the HTML manual. The size of the figure in the PDF manual can
be adjusted in the info file, as explained in the next section. "lw
2.5" makes the lines 2.5 thicker than the default value, and 30 is the
size of the font which will be used (Helvetica by default).

The two figures plotting2.gif and plotting2.pdf where created using
the programs convert, from Imagemagick, and epstopdf, from the CTAN
Tex/LaTeX archive:

  convert -bordercolor white -border 0x0 plotting2.ps plotting2.gif
  epstopdf plotting2.ps

The file plotting2.ps has been included (in compressed form) in this
directory just for reference.

ADDING FIGURES TO THE MANUAL
----------------------------

To add a figure to the manual, for instance figure plotting2, use the
following lines in the info document:

@ifnotinfo
@image{figures/plotting2, 8cm}
@end ifnotinfo

notice that the file path and name shoud be written without including
the name extension (neither .gif nor .pdf need to be given). The 8cm
width will be used in the PDF manual only, and not in the HTML manual.
You might want to adjust that size for different figures.

In the translations of the manual into other languages, the above
lines should be translated into:

@ifnotinfo
@image{../figures/plotting2, 8cm}
@end ifnotinfo

In order to ease the use of the figures found in the manual as a testbench
for the plotting functions all new plot commands should be added to
the .wxm files in the "tests" directory of the maxima source tree.
